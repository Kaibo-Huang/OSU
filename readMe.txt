**It is recommended to play the Tutorial level first, in order to understand the basic mechanics of each type of object. As this is an audio-based game, sound is necessary for playing**

At its core, Osu! is a game about clicking circles. When a circle appears, there will be an "approach circle" closing in on the "inner circle". Once both of these touch, you will need to click. For circles, clicking mechanisms will be done through mouse clicks, 'z' and 'x' keys.
 
There is another type of object called a Slider. For sliders, click, hold and drag using 'z' and 'x' keys ONLY, as mouse clicks are not recommended in high level professional Osu! play. If a slider contains an arrow at the end of it, you will need to maintain holding the 'z' or 'x' keys, and follow the Reverse Slider all the way there and back. 

Be sure to pay attention to your score. If you see anything less than 300, you are either clicking too early or too late. This is reflected in your accuracy. Completely missing an object will reset your combo. The combo is a multiplier for the score (0, 100 or 300) that you receive for every successful, or unsuccessful, click of the mouse. 

After each play, you will have the option to view your score for a couple of seconds. After this, you will be given an opportunity to save your score to the leaderboard. Only top 5 scores will be displayed on this leaderboard. 

Have fun and enjoy!
