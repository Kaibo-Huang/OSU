/* GamePanel class acts as the main "game loop" - continuously runs the game and calls whatever needs to be called

Child of JPanel because JPanel contains methods for drawing to the screen

Implements KeyListener interface to listen for keyboard input

Implements Runnable interface to use "threading" - let the game do two things at once
